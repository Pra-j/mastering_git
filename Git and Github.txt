Git.
1. Create a repo, navigate to that repo in cmd and run 'git init' command.
2. Create any folder or files inside the repo and commit to the git.
    -> git add "filename" (for staging files of your choice)
    -> git add . (for staging all files new and changed)
    -> git commit -m "your message"
3. use "git log" command to see all the commits.
4. to rollback to previous commit use "git checkout commit id" command.
5. to undo the rollback use "git checkout main" command.

To link your local repo to cloud/remote repo (github)
1. Open github and create repository.
2. copy origin url and use command "git remote add origin originURL.
3. Now to link use "git push -u origin main"

Some advance git commands
To create a branch, use "git branch branch-name"
To switch to newly created branch use "git checkout branch-name"
To create and immediately switch to new branch use "git checkout -b branch-name"
To create a branch from some specific branch you should run "git branch new-branch-name source-branch"
This will not automatically add new branch in the cloud repo, for adding this branch you need to publish the local branch with command "git push --set-upstream origin branch-name"

Note: git branch will branch from that specific branch. Eg: If you are in main-branch and run "git branch" it'll create branch from main.
The git commit messages should be imperative (like giving command) it should answer the fill in the blank "If applied to the codebase this commit will ___________."
